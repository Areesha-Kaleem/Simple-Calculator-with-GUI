It allows users to perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulus, and factorial calculations. The background color changes dynamically based on the operation selected, providing visual feedback to the user.

GUI Components: It creates a JFrame window with labels, text fields, and buttons for user input and displaying results.

Button Actions: Each button (+, -, x, /, x^, |x|, C, P) performs a specific arithmetic operation when clicked. The result is displayed in a text field.

Background Color: The background color changes based on the operation performed, giving visual feedback to the user.

Factorial Calculation: The code includes a method to calculate factorial, used for permutations (P) and combinations (C) calculations.

ActionListener: The class implements ActionListener interface to handle button clicks and perform corresponding operations.

In simple terms, this code creates a calculator where users can perform basic arithmetic operations and factorial calculations with visual feedback on the result.
